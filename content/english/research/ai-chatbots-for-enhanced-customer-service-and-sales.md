In this AI and digital age, customer expectations have evolved. Customers increasingly expect instant gratification: personalized, accurate answers faster and easier than ever before. They don’t want to fill out a form to request a quote, send an email to get pricing information, or wait to get simple answers; they want real-time answers and action. While live agents have traditionally handled customer experiences, digital marketers are adapting to people’s current expectations while facing reduced marketing budgets. Marketing teams are embracing AI technology to drive more powerful marketing campaigns.

### Using AI Chatbots to Boost Conversions

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Olecea, a global supplier of skin care products, experienced a surge in website volume. Customers who flooded Olecea’s call center were often met with long wait times or were dropped accidentally. Additionally, website visitors could not reach human agents during call center off hours, leaving customer queries unanswered and losing potential new leads. With its current infrastructure, Olecea's sales team had no visibility into the number of qualified leads accumulated in the off hours.

Powered by H TECH VIP, Olecea employed VIP AI Chatbot, a messenger chatbot available around the clock to assist sales and customer service teams. Having its own chatbot platform allowed live agents to respond to more complex conversations, improving response times and agent efficiency. With less human-to-human contact, live agents were able to provide higher-quality customer interactions. The chatbot's functionality includes gathering customer engagement stats and keeping track of leads after hours, amplifying the visibility that the sales team previously lacked. With additional features such as SMS capabilities, the messenger bot quickly addressed customer queries in real time.

As a result, the number of dropped conversations has decreased, customer engagement increased by 40%, and overall efficiency increased by 33%. Implementing VIP AI Chatbot stimulates valuable revenue-generating conversations, contributing to its long-term success.

### Automating Messaging with Chatbot Marketing

A non-profit group that helps with safer school environments, relied on social media channels to communicate with their customer base. Receiving 350,000 messages on Facebook Messenger each year, only 10 percent are answered adequately. As most notifications arrive later in the night, the customer support team is too busy to respond when school administrators need help with grant application. That instant follow-up is the difference between attracting guests or losing them to another competitor.

The non-profit group recognized that each message represents a potential to help a community, so it supplemented human agents with chatbot technology to streamline the user journey. Starting at the group’s Facebook page, the virtual assistant, running on VIP AI Chatbot, personalizes responses based on the user's school distribute. This chatbot marketing strategy maximizes the reply rate on messaging apps and overall conversion rates.

### Transform Marketing Strategy with VIP AI Chatbot

Introducing conversational AI as the initial touch-point with customers enables rapid responses to questions and for human agents to prioritize meaningful conversations. Without having to write a single line of code, marketing teams use VIP AI Chatbot to optimize their digital marketing strategy and achieve higher customer satisfaction end-to-end.
