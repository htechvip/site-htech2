### Scaling AI Safely and Responsibly

The vast potentials of AI come hand-in-hand with equally significant responsibilities. AI's ripple effect on human life has propelled critical discussions on ethics, data governance, trust, and legal implications. According to a 2022 Tech Vision study by Accenture, a mere 35% of consumers globally trust AI's organizational applications, with 77% demanding accountability for its misuse.

Organizations harnessing AI must be alert to evolving regulations, ensuring they remain compliant. Enter the realm of *Responsible AI*.
